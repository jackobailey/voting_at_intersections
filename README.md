# Voting at the Intersections of Sexuality and Gender

## Abstract

Thanks to recent efforts, we now know more about sexual minority voters than ever before. Still, much of this work overlooks one important point: that sexual minorities differ. Drawing on intersectional feminist theory, we investigate how gender structures these differences. To do so, we use new data from YouGov's proprietary Cube database. This unique resource includes hundreds of thousands of British voters, several thousand of whom identify as a sexual minority. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest sample of sexual minority voters ever assembled. Our findings confirm our expectations: gender does shape sexual minority voting. Indeed, in some cases, sexual identity effects are more than twice as large for women as for men. As a result, most current research on sexual minority voting likely overlooks that sexual identity is more important in motivating the voting behavior of women than of men.

## Notes

This repository contains replication files for our project *"Voting at the Intersections of Sexuality and Gender"*. Unfortunately, we are not able to share the proprietary YouGov data that we use to conduct our analysis. However, we include here all of the scripts necessary to conduct our analysis in the spirit of openness, plus a copy of the pre-print manuscript and the accompanying presentation.
